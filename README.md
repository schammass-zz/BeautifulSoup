# BeautifulSoup

Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents (including having malformed markup, i.e. non-closed tags, so named after tag soup). It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping.

My code was developed in order that you can find a job on website https://www.timesjobs.com/ where Python can be a skill.
